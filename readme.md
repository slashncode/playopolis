- Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

2. Install AndroidStudio:

- Download the latest version of AndroidStudio from the official website.
- Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

3. Set up Android Studio:

- open Android Studio and go to Settings/Preferences.
- In the settings window, navigate to Appearance & Behavior > System Settings > Android SDK.
- Click on the SDK Platforms tab and select the desired API level for your project.
- Click on the SDK Tools tab and check the necessary tools for your project.
- Click Apply or OK to install the selected SDK components.

4. Import the Project:

- Open Android Studio and select Open an existing Android Studio project.
- Navigate to the location where you cloned or downloaded the project and select the project directory.
- Wait for Android Studio to import the project and resolve dependencies.

5. Build and Run:

- Connect an Android device to your computer or use an emulator.
- In Android Studio, click on the Run button (green triangle) in the toolbar or select Run > Run 'app' from the menu.
- Select the target device/emulator and click OK.
- Wait for the build process to complete and the app to launch on the target device.

### To install the app on your phone:

1. Enable Unknown Sources: By default, Android doesn't allow installations from unknown sources. To enable it, go to your phone's Settings, then select "Security" or "Lock screen and security" (the exact name may vary depending on your device and Android version). Look for the option "Unknown sources" and toggle it on.

2. Connect your phone to your computer: Use a USB cable to connect your Android phone to your computer.

3. Transfer the APK to your phone: Copy the unsigned APK file from your computer to your phone. You can simply drag and drop the file into the phone's storage or use the file transfer utility provided by your computer's operating system.

4. Locate the APK file on your phone: Open a file manager app on your Android phone and navigate to the location where you copied the APK file.

5. Install the APK: Tap on the APK file to begin the installation process. You may see a warning message about installing from unknown sources, but since you've enabled it in the previous step, you can proceed with the installation.

6. Follow the prompts: Android will guide you through the installation process. You may need to grant certain permissions requested by the app during installation.

7. Complete the installation: Once the installation is complete, you'll see a confirmation message. You can now open the app from your app drawer or home screen and start using it.

Congratulations! You have successfully set up and started Playopolis.
